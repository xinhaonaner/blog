        <a href="https://www.patreon.com/canvas" target="_blank"><strong>Canvas is officially on Patreon!</strong></a> If you've been using
        Canvas for some time now and want to show your love and support for the platform, consider
        <a href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=4872869" target="_blank">making a pledge</a> to
        keep the bug fixes, issue resolution, and app updates progressing at a rapid pace. Pledges start as low as
        $2, and some pretty cool rewards accompany each level. <br><br>Maintaining and developing new
        features for Canvas takes a considerable amount of time. Regardless of what is generated here, I'll
        continue to develop this project because it's a passion of mine, <em>but a cup of coffee every once in a while definitely helps!</em>

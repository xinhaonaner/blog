        Due to popular demand, Canvas now supports <strong>user management</strong>! You can now create or edit users and assign them specific roles to be either a basic user
        or a site administrator. Lots of new unit tests were added to cover that portion of the application. Check out the
        <a href="https://github.com/cnvs/canvas/releases/tag/v2.1.13" target="_blank">release notes</a> for a more thorough look at what we
        improved upon in this update.
